# PYTHON_BOOK_MY_SHOW_INTERNSHIP_PROJECT
During my internship with Dev Skill Hub Training and Consultancies, I worked on developing a comprehensive "Book My Show" application in Python. 
This project aimed to provide users with a seamless movie booking experience by creating and integrating several functions. 
The key functions included:

tmovie: For selecting the movie name.

city: For choosing the city.

theatre: For selecting the theatre.

screen: For choosing the screen number.

timing: For choosing movie timing slots.

payment: For processing the payment based on user choices.

The city function was the first function I created and connected, serving as the entry point for the booking process. This function allows users to select their city, which is crucial for determining the 
available theatres, screens, and show timings. Here is a brief overview of the implementation and the steps involved:

City Function: The first step in the booking process is to choose the city. The city function presents the user with a list of available cities to select from. This selection determines the subsequent options for 
theatres, screens, and timings.

Integration and Connectivity: Before calling the city function, I ensured that it was properly integrated into the application framework. This involved connecting it with other functions such as theatre selection 
and timing slots to ensure a smooth transition between different stages of the booking process.

Calling the City Function: With the city function in place, I proceeded to call it within the application. This function acted as the starting point, initiating the user interaction and guiding them through the 
subsequent steps of selecting a theatre, screen, timing, and making the payment.

Execution in Jupyter Notebook: The entire application was executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment, allowing for interactive testing and demonstration. The successful execution demonstrated my ability to create 
and connect various functionalities seamlessly, ensuring a user-friendly movie booking experience.

This project not only showcased my skills in Python programming and function integration but also highlighted my ability to work on real-world applications that require careful planning and execution. The "Book 
My Show" application stands as a testament to my dedication and technical expertise developed during my internship.
